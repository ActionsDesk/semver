# Semver action

This is a **GitHub Action** for creating releases using [**Semantic versioning**](https://semver.org).

It automatically increments the version number from the previous latest release using the [bumping semantics shown below](#how-it-works).


This action modelled after [Concourse Semver resource](https://github.com/concourse/semver-resource) which is used in [Concourse pipelines](https://concourse-ci.org/).

## How it works

The action takes the following inputs:

- **bump**: Create the next release after bumping the version number semantically.
  
  **required**: true  
  **default**: 'minor' 

  The value must be one of: 
  - *major*: Create a release after bumping the major version. e.g. 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0.
  - *minor*: Create a release after bumping the minor version. e.g. 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0.
  - *patch*: Create a release after bumping the patch version. e.g. 0.1.0 -> 0.1.2.
  - *pre*: Create a release as a pre-release. e.g. the version e.g. 0.1.0 > 0.1.0-alpha.1; 0.1.1-alpha.1 -> 0.1.1-alpha.2
  
    When bumping to a pre-release, if the previous version is already a pre-release, it would bump the `build number`. If it is a new pre-release the `build number` would default at `1`. If the version is a prerelease of another type, (e.g. `label` is alpha vs. beta), the type is switched and the prerelease version is reset to 1. If the version is not already a pre-release, then `label` is added, starting at 1.

  - *final*: Promote the version to a final version, e.g. 1.0.0-rc.1 -> 1.0.0.'


- **prelabel**: Label to be used for pre-release tags. The value can be any string. Good examples are `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`, etc. 
  
  â€‹**required**: false  
  **default**: 'alpha' 

- **initial_version**: If there is no current version, the bump will be based on initial_version or 0.1.0
  
  **required**: false  
  **default**: 0.1.0

## How to use

To use this **GitHub** Action you will need to complete the following:

1. Add the task in your workflow where you see fit. You can use the example below as a reference.
1. Modify the example to pass the correct values for `bump`. Values for `prelabel`, `initial_version` are optional.

### Example connecting GitHub Action Workflow

In your repository you should have a `.github/workflows` folder with **GitHub** Action similar to below:

- `.github/workflows/test.yml`

This file should look like the following:

```yml
---
name: "sample-workflow"
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'releases/*'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: decyjphr-actions/semver
      with:
        bump: pre
        prelabel: beta
```

## Limitations

- When creating a pre-release it does not use the `pre-release` setting in GitHub. This would be fixed later.
- It does not create a pre-release without a `build number`. For e.g. `0.1.0` would be bumped to `0.1.0-alpha.1` but not to `0.1.0-alpha`.
